# How to Publish Your Cold Email App for Public Access

## 🚨 Current Issue
Your app is in "Testing" mode and can only be accessed by your Gmail account. Other users get "Access blocked" error.

## 🔧 Solution: Publish Your App

### Step 1: Go to Google Cloud Console
1. Visit: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Select your "Cold Email Automation" project
3. Go to "APIs & Services" → "OAuth consent screen"

### Step 2: Change Publishing Status
1. **Current Status**: "Testing" (restricted to test users)
2. **Click "PUBLISH APP"** button
3. **Confirm** that you want to make the app available to all users

### Step 3: Configure OAuth Consent Screen
1. **User Type**: Keep as "External" (for public access)
2. **App Information**:
   - App name: "Cold Email Automation"
   - User support email: your email
   - Developer contact: your email
3. **Scopes**: Ensure these are added:
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send`
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly`
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`

### Step 4: Add App Domain (Optional but Recommended)
1. **Authorized domains**: Add your domain if you have one
2. **Developer contact information**: Your email
3. **Privacy policy**: Create a simple privacy policy (required for public apps)

### Step 5: Submit for Verification (If Required)
1. **Google may require verification** for apps with sensitive scopes
2. **This process can take 1-7 days**
3. **During verification**: Your app will still work for users

## 🎯 Alternative: Quick Fix for Testing

### Option A: Add Test Users (Immediate)
1. Go to "OAuth consent screen"
2. Scroll to "Test users"
3. Click "ADD USERS"
4. Add your friends' Gmail addresses
5. **Save** - they can now access the app immediately

### Option B: Use Internal App (If you have Google Workspace)
1. Change "User Type" to "Internal"
2. Only works if you have Google Workspace domain
3. All users in your domain can access

## 📋 Required Information for Public App

### Privacy Policy (Required)
Create a simple privacy policy stating:
- What data you collect (Gmail access)
- How you use it (send emails)
- That you don't store user data permanently
- Contact information

### Terms of Service (Recommended)
Basic terms about:
- App usage
- User responsibilities
- Data handling
